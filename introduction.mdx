SlotoLand system accesses the player's wallet in the Client's system in realtime to retrieve player's balance and to
perform credit, debit and cancel transactions. This communication is handled by the SlotoLand api server.

- RESTful service with lightweight JSON-formatted requests/responses
- Requests are made via HTTP POST method, containing JSON request object in request body (all responses should contain header "content-type: application/json")
- Served over HTTPS - to ensure security and data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported

The Client must implement Callback service in their system. Using this service, system will work with the playerâ€™s balance in the system.

The Callback service must implement the following operations:
- balance
- bet
- win
- refund

As for authentication, each request contains a cryptographic hash (parameter sign) calculated from the data to be transmitted.

<Tip>
The only expected HTTP Status Code is 200 (OK). Business logic related errors are communicated directly in response JSON data content.
